# BASE-COMPONENTS

Contains components that are used on almost all pages.

## **All Base-Components can be used without local registration. You don't need to import them. ðŸ˜‰**

If Base Components need to be seperated into multiple sub-files, only the vue file with the same name as the folder will be registerd globally.
